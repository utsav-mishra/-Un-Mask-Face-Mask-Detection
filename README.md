# Un-Mask : Face-Mask-Detection

<h5> Built a Face Mask Detector using Keras, Tensorflow, MobileNet and OpenCV.<br> It is then applied to Live Video Camera. I believe that with necessary improvements this model can be easily integreated with CCTV cameras at traffic signals,grocery stores hospitals and other places with a proper CCTV setup to detect and identify people with and without masks with a accuracy indicator.

The face mask detector didn't use any morphed masked images dataset. The model is accurate, and since the MobileNetV2 architecture is used, itâ€™s also computationally efficient and thus making it easier to deploy the model to embedded systems (Raspberry Pi, Google Coral, etc.).

This system can therefore be used in real-time applications which require face-mask detection for safety purposes due to the outbreak of Covid-19. This project can be integrated with embedded systems for application in airports, railway stations, offices, schools, and public places to ensure that public safety guidelines are followed. </h5>
